PROGRESS:
=========
- 'rect' example works
- EOS class module works


TODO:
=====
- write a function for the EOS module that finds the Temperature


DONE:
=====
- embed EOS class using cython
- (since you'll need to do this for the EOS class)
--- found an example using 'Rectangle's, let's see if I can get it to work ...
----- done
--- let's copy and paste some stuff!
- It looks like it works! (i.e. the module imports and the functions are
  recognized). Now to test it ...
- DONE

- figure out what exactly system() does (so I know if it's really working)
--- just runs (some) shell commands

- run get_rho in C++ and make sure you can get it working that way
- DONE
